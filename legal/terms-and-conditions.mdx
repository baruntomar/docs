## 11. Free and Paid Features

Desifounder is currently offered as a **free platform** to support founders, builders, and the startup community. To sustainably maintain, improve, and operate the platform in the long term, certain **current or future features may be introduced as paid or “Pro” features**.

Any such changes will be implemented thoughtfully and transparently. We will provide **advance notice and clear communication** to existing users before introducing paid features. This may include updates via email, in-platform notifications, and revisions to these Terms & Conditions.

Users will always have the choice to continue using available free features or opt into paid features where applicable. Introducing paid features will not affect your ownership of existing content or access to previously available free functionality unless explicitly stated.

Continued use of the platform after such updates indicates acceptance of the revised terms.

We may update these Terms from time to time. Updated versions will be posted on this page with the “Last Updated” date revised. Continued use of the Platform means you accept the new Terms.

## 13. Governing Law
