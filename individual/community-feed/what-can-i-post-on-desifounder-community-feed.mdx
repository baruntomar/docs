You can post discussions, news, opportunities, resources, or even lighthearted content, which will show up in the main community feed.

To keep things organized, posts are categorized into [**Docks**](https://desifounder.com/docks)—dedicated spaces with specific purposes. Just make sure you place your posts under the right **Dock**.
