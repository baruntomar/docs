### What is Spotlight?

Spotlight is a weekly feature on desifounder where makers, founders, and startups can showcase their products, tools, or platforms to the community. It's a dedicated space to get discovered, receive feedback, and grow visibility within a targeted, like-minded audience.

### Who can post in Spotlight?

Any registered user on desifounder can apply to feature their startup or project on Spotlight. Whether you're a solo founder, team, student, or indie hacker, you're welcome to share what you're building.

### Is it free to launch on Spotlight?

Yes, launching your product on Spotlight is always free. During our beta phase, we also provide all premium features of Spotlight without any additional charges or subscriptions. We believe in giving early-stage startups and builders an accessible way to gain visibility and validation.

### When can I launch on Spotlight?

You can submit your startup to Spotlight anytime during the week. However, all approved entries are launched publicly every Monday. We manually screen each submission to ensure quality, relevance, and to keep the Spotlight section free from spam. If your submission is approved, it will be included in the next Monday’s Spotlight lineup.

### What are the benefits of launching on Spotlight?

Spotlight helps your startup gain traction by:

- Getting Early BETA Testers for your Product
- Reaching a niche founder and startup audience
- Receiving constructive feedback from fellow builders
- Getting featured in community newsletters, socials or posts
- Earning upvotes and visibility from early supporters

### How often can I launch on Spotlight?

You can only launch the same product once on desifounder to avoid spam and repetition, unless there has been a significant update or major redesign. If you’ve made significant updates or launched a new version, you can reapply after a cooldown period of 30 days.

### How does the approval process work?

All Spotlight submissions go through a manual review by the desifounder team. We check for relevance, originality, and alignment with the community’s standards. Once approved, your entry will be added to the upcoming Monday Spotlight release.

### What kind of startups or projects are allowed?

Any kind of startup, tool, product, or project in the tech, business, creator, manufacturing, or entrepreneurship space is welcome. Whether you're in the ideation stage, MVP, beta, or fully launched and funded. However, we do not allow illegal NSFW, adult, scammy, MLM, or non-relevant promotions. If found any, please report the particular project.

### Can I edit my submission after applying?

Yes, you can edit your submission anytime before the Spotlight goes live on Monday. Once your product is launched, it becomes publicly visible, indexed on the platform, and open for upvotes. At that point, the content is locked and can no longer be changed.

### Will I be notified if my project is approved?

Yes, you will receive an email or in-platform notification once your Spotlight submission is approved and scheduled to go live.
